In the prometheus/ directory in this repo, you'll find example Prometheus configurations to scrape the exporters once per 5 minutes as to not induce extra load on your servers. If your PG servers aren't heavily loaded, you can scrape them at whatever interval you like.

In the grafana/ directory you'll find a Grafana 6.0+ dashboard that uses information from the postgres-exporter plus netdata to give you a full view of your PostgreSQL hosts.
